                <p class="text">Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, known as the "Missile Man of India," exemplified perseverance throughout his life.
                    Born into a humble family, he faced financial constraints but never let them hinder his education.
                    He worked tirelessly, balancing his studies with part-time jobs.
                    Despite initial failures, Kalam's persistence shone through when he joined ISRO and led the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle, SLV-3, which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in orbit.
                    <br><br><br>
                        One of his most remarkable achievements came after the failure of the Agni missile test in 1989.
                    Undeterred by setbacks and criticism, Kalam motivated his team, leading to a successful test in 1992.
                    His unwavering determination and belief in India's scientific potential were pivotal in advancing the country's missile and space programs.
                    Dr. Kalamâ€™s life and career inspire millions to persistently chase their dreams, emphasizing that setbacks are merely stepping stones to success.

      <h1>Perseverance</h1>
      <p>Perseverance is the steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success.</p>

              <p>We, the Explorers group, have observed that many among us, including our peers, struggle to achieve our goals. A significant factor contributing to this is a lack of persistence. We often give up too easily and tend to back off without making another attempt.</p>

                  <h2>Why We Struggle with Perseverance</h2>
                  <ul>

              <span class="step-number">1.</span>
              <p> <b>Write Down Your Top-Level Goal</b><br>
                Clearly define your ultimate goal. It should be specific and not vague. For example, instead of saying, "I want to be fit," say, "I want to run a marathon in six months."

              <p> <b>Make a Pyramid of Goals</b><br>
                Visualize your goals as a pyramid rather than a to-do list. The top of the pyramid is your ultimate goal, and the lower levels are the mid-level and low-level goals that support it."</p>

          <li>
              <span class="step-number">3.</span>
              <p> <b>Tasks are Low-Level Goals</b><br>
                Break down your mid-level goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Each task you complete is a step towards achieving your higher-level goals.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="step-number">4.</span>
              <p> <b>Overcome Setbacks with Analysis</b><br>
                When you encounter setbacks, analyze what went wrong and why. Use this understanding to adjust your approach and keep moving forward."</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="step-number">5.</span>
              <p> <b>Reevaluation</b><br>
                Periodically reevaluate your goals and progress. This helps ensure that you are on the right track and allows you to make necessary adjustments.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="step-number">6.</span>
            <p> <b>Take Rest</b><br>
              Allow yourself to take breaks and rest. Rest is crucial for maintaining long-term productivity and preventing burnout.
