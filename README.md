We have created a blog about perseverance, aiming to spread awareness so that anyone, at any time, can learn about one of the fundamental pillars of leadership: perseverance.

In this innovative project, we have combined our engineering skills, specifically in web development, to craft a blog dedicated to this crucial leadership pillar.
